        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! I'm Tom Liu, a committed and passionate first-year Sociology major at the University of California-Riverside. With unwavering dedication to academic excellence, I have been able to maintain an impeccable 4.00 GPA, positioning me on the Dean's list and distinguishing me as a recipient of the UCR Achievement Full scholarship. My academic journey, lit by the honor of being the Valedictorian of my high school, has been the epitome of my undying thirst for knowledge and unflinching devotion towards accomplishing the highest standards of academic distinction.With my childhood spent in a vibrant multicultural environment, I had the privilege of picking up fluently bilingual abilities in both English and Mandarin languages. This level of language proficiency was further cultivated during my time at Changchun American International School, which not only expanded my linguistic skills but also deepened my understanding of diverse cultures, greatly supporting my social dynamics. This unique upbringing has engraved in me a global perspective that has adequately enabled me to appreciate and understand the dynamics of cultural diversity and its effect on fostering social interrelationships.At the University of California, my fondness for Sociology has been given fertile ground to flourish. My coursework and engagements outside the classroom have allowed me to weave my real-world experiences with theoretical knowledge to enrich my understanding of how societal structures are so inextricably woven. This academic journey was more than just textbooks and lectures; it has been an integral experience that honed my analytical skills and imparted a deeper understanding of social phenomena.<br><br>

       Leadership featured prominently as a trait when I decided to pioneer the establishment of the Script Reasoning | Board Game Club in college. As the founding president, I was able to create an intellectual oasis for secondary students, focusing on teamwork and fostering cognitive growth through thought-provoking activities. This club provided an avenue for learners to have meaningful interactions that nurtured their problem-solving and strategic thinking skills in a collaborative and fun environment.I have always demonstrated my dedication to learning worldwide perspectives and contributing to sociological research with my active involvement in programs such as the UN Spotlight Training Program and the CIA Sociology Project. These experiences have helped sharpen my analytical skills and explore areas in international relations, particularly education inequalities. It has offered me a priceless opportunity to put sociological theories into practical use in real-life problems, thus going a step further in applying my practical and theoretical knowledge about global social challenges.<br><br>

        Beside the academic life, I have always been conveying how limitless could be the value of voluntary and extracurricular participation as an inherent part of the personality development or a way to enhance professional skills. As a class representative, I have dealt with several of the school events in which were found useful in promoting student participation and get involved as belongingness. My involvement in those said activities not only underlined some of my organizational skills but also brought out my capability to gather people together towards a common course.My experience has provided a vast range of exposures harboring advanced problem-solving, effectiveness in multitasking, adaptability to environmental changes, and exceptional communication abilities. My drive and dependability have received little or no complaints in any team-oriented project.Looking further, the adrenaline to further inject my academics with practical experiences cannot be overstated since this is the power that has been making me push boundaries as I contribute towards societal change. I look forward to interacting with individuals and organizations whose goal and visions align with mine to make a positive impact in the world. Together, let us seek avenues that enhance progress to bring about change within our societies.
